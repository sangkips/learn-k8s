# Deployments

- A Deployment manages a set of Pods to run an application workloads
- It provides a declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets
- Ensures specified number of Pod replicas are running
- Handles rolling updates and rollbacks
- It provides declarative updates to the Pod

deployment.yaml file

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```
To create the above deployment run the following command 

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Run `kubectl get deployments` to check if deployments was successful

To check how many replicaSets are running use `kubectl get rs`

To see the labels automatically generated for each pod, run `kubectl get pods --show-labels`

### Updating Deployment

A Deployment's rollout is only triggered if and only if a Deployment's Pod template(`.spec.template`) is changed

Scalling the Deployment doesn't trigger a rollout

To update the Deployment do the following 

- Update the image from `nginx:1.14.2` to `nginx:1.16.1`
```
kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```
or 

```
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

Alternatively edit the Deployment

```
kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment
```

### Rolling Back to the previous revision

To undo the current rollout and go back to the previous version, do the following:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment 
```

Alternatively to go back to speciifc revision,

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
```

To check if the rollback was successful use the following `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment` or you can desccribe the deployment `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment`.

### Scaling Deployment

To scale deployment in k8s use the following 

```
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
```
If Horizontal Pod Autosccaling is enabled, you can setup autoscaler and specify the minimum and maximum number of pods based on CPU of the existing pods.

```
kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80
```
