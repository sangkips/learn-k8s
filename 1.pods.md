# Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units in computing that you can create and manage in kubernetes.

- Think of a Pod as wrapper that contains one or more containers
- Containers in the same pod share storage and network resources
- Pods are designed to run a single application instance

Example of a pod pod.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-web-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: frontend
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
In order to create the above pod run the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

NB: You will rarely create pods in kubernetes, this is because Pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities.

To manage Pods effectively, use workload resources to create and manage multiple pods.

Controller for the resource handle rollout and replication and automatic healing incase of a Pod failure.

### Workload resources managing pods
